# Hi I'm Ares 

I'm a computer scientist and I love coding! ðŸ’–

I code now for more than 15 years, normally I code in C#, but since now 2 years I learned Python and I fell in love.

I am a passionate about the world of blockchain and therefore cryptocurrency, I participate more and more with this community of developers on projects about bot creation.

I hope to succeed in doing something good in the near future. ðŸ’»

By the way I shouldn't tell you but right now I'm coding an amazing bot ðŸ‘€ðŸ¤«

See you soon ðŸ¤™
